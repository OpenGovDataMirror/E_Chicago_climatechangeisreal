<h3>1. Buy smart: Purchase a fuel-efficient, low-greenhouse gasÂ vehicle</h3>

<p>When shopping for a new or used vehicle (or even renting a vehicle), choose the cleanest, most fuel-efficient vehicle that meets your needs. With a wide range of clean, fuel-efficient vehicles available today, itâ€™s easier than ever to go greenâ€”for the environment and for your wallet. Check out <a href="/greenvehicles">EPA's Green Vehicle Guide</a> or <a href="http://www.fueleconomy.gov/">www.fueleconomy.gov</a> to find the best, most comprehensive information on vehicle emissions and fuel economy.</p>

<p>You can also learn more about the <a href="https://www3.epa.gov/otaq/carlabel/basicinformation.htm">fuel economy and environment label</a> that youâ€™ll see on all new vehicles. The labelÂ has been redesigned and <span
    class="figure image file file-image file-image-png left view-mode-media_original caption" style="width:200px;"><img alt="See larger image with details" title="See larger image with details" height="130" width="200" class="left media-element file-media-original" typeof="foaf:Image" src="/sites/production/files/2016-07/gasoline_vehicle_label.png" /><span class="figcaption">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://www3.epa.gov/carlabel/gaslabel.htm">Gasoline Vehicle Label</a></span></span>updated for even easier comparison shopping.Â These new window stickers provide fuel economy and environmental ratings for all new vehicles, including advanced technology vehicles like electric cars and plug-in hybrids.Â And while at the showroom, you can scan the QR CodeÂ® on each vehicleâ€™s label to be connected to additional information online, including personalized cost and energy-use estimates.</p>

<h3>2. Drive smart</h3>

<p>To improve your fuel economy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, go easy on the brakes and gas pedal, avoid hard accelerations, reduce your time spent idling (no more than 30 seconds), and unload unnecessary items in your trunk to reduce weight. If you have a removable roof rack and you are not using it, take it off to improve your fuel economy. Use cruise control if you have it, and for vehicles with selectable four-wheel drive, consider operating in two-wheel drive mode when road conditions make it safe to do so.</p>

<p>For more information, take a look at these tips for <a href="http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/driveHabits.jsp">driving more efficiently</a>.</p>

<h3>3. Remember maintenance...</h3>

<p>Get regular tune-ups, follow the manufacturerâ€™s maintenance schedule (which can be found in your ownerâ€™s manual), and use the recommended grade of motor oil. A well-maintained car is more fuel-efficient, produces fewer greenhouse gas emissions, is more reliable, and is safer!</p>

<p>For more details, including potential fuel savings, check out these tips for <a href="http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/maintain.jsp">keeping your car in shape</a>.</p>

<h3>4. ... and donâ€™t forget your tires!</h3>

<p>Check your tire pressure regularly. Under-inflation increases tire wear, reduces your fuel economy, and leads to higher greenhouse gas and other air pollutant emissions. If you donâ€™t know the correct tire pressure for your vehicle, you can find it listed on the door to your vehicleâ€™s glove compartment, or on the driver's-side door pillar.</p>

<p>And when itâ€™s time for new tires, consider purchasing tires with â€œlow rolling resistance,â€? an energy-saving feature.</p>

<h3>5. Give your car a break</h3>

<p>Use <a href="http://www.publictransportation.org/Pages/default.aspx">public transportation</a> <a class="exit-disclaimer" href="/home/exit-epa" title="EPA's External Link Disclaimer">Exit</a>, <a href="http://www.commuterchoice.com/">carpool</a> <a class="exit-disclaimer" href="/home/exit-epa" title="EPA's External Link Disclaimer">Exit</a>, or <a href="http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/bicycle_pedestrian/index.cfm">walk or bike</a> whenever possible to avoid using your car.Â Leaving your car at home just two days a week can reduce your greenhouse gas emissions by an average ofÂ 2 tons per year.</p>

<p>Also consider telecommuting (working from home via phone or the Internet), which can reduce the stress of commuting, reduce harmful emissions, and save you money.Â And when driving, try combining your errands and activities into one trip.</p>

<h3>6. Use renewable fuels</h3>

<p>Give <a href="/renewable-fuel-standard-program/e85-fuel">E85 and biodiesel</a> a try.Â Both are renewable fuels (made from renewable sources such as corn) that can reduce greenhouse gas emissions from your vehicle.Â E85 is a fuel blend containing 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline that can be used in certain vehicles called Flex Fuel Vehicles (FFVs).Â FFVs are designed to be fueled with either E85 or traditional gasoline. There are millions of FFVs on the road todayâ€”to find out if you own one, check the inside of your car's fuel door for an identification sticker, or consult your ownerâ€™s manual.</p>

<p>If you own a diesel vehicle, consider filling up with a biodiesel blend such as B5, which is a diesel fuel blend containing 5% biodiesel.</p>

<p>The Department of Energyâ€™s <a href="http://www.afdc.energy.gov/locator/stations/">Alternative Fueling Station Locator</a>Â can help you locate both E85 and biodiesel fuel stations in your area.</p>
